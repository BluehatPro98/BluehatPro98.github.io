      states that,“Since 2017, government programs have removed 90,000 children
      from hazardous labor conditions, and over 35,000 children from
      exploitative work. Within 15 ministries responsible for children in some
      way, the government of Bangladesh increased its spending on children by 17
      percent between the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 fiscal years.”
